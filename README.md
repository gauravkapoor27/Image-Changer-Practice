# Image-Changer-Practice

Simple project built using vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS. 

Features a button on the bottom of the main container which changes the image. The image also updates periodically on its own.

This project was built to improve my CSS styling skills and also to learn about DOM manipulation and setTimeout functionality in JavaScript.
