# Image-Changer-Practice

Simple project built using vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS. Features buttons on the left and write of the main container which change image. 
Used CSS to add nice transitions. This project was built to improve my CSS styling skills and also to learn about DOM manipulation in vanilla
JavaScript.
